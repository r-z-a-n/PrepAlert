Many university students may struggle in their academic life at some point. In turn, multiple external
support tools have been provided in the form of websites and applications to aid students. However, it
can become very tedious to access separate platforms all in the name of managing their academic life,
students already have too much on their plates to visit each of these different platforms as it
as becomes easy to get lost in all the things they're required to manage. Our application will strive to
provide a single centralized space to organize most of the things that matter to college students. from
trying to maintain their GPA, and keeping track of all their deadlines, to planning a schedule for all
their classes' times, places, and instructors.
